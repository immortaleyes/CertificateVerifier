# Certificate Verifier

## Project Overview

**Certificate Verifier** is a tool designed to verify the authenticity of certificates. It provides a secure and efficient way to ensure that the certificates are valid, have been issued by the correct organization, and have not been tampered with. This tool can be used by organizations, employers, or educational institutions to verify the legitimacy of certificates issued by various platforms or institutions.

The tool ensures:
- **Certificate authenticity**: Verifies that the certificate was indeed issued by the platform or institution.
- **Data integrity**: Ensures that the certificate data has not been altered or tampered with.
- **Cross-platform support**: The tool can handle certificates from various platforms and institutions.

## Features

### Key Features:
- **Certificate Validation**: Validates the authenticity and integrity of certificates issued by multiple institutions.
- **Cross-Referencing**: Compares the certificate data with a secure database to confirm its authenticity.
- **Tamper Detection**: Detects any changes or alterations in the certificate data since it was issued.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Supports certificates from various institutions and platforms, such as **online learning platforms**, **universities**, and **professional certifications**.
- **Batch Processing**: Allows you to upload and validate multiple certificates at once, making bulk verifications easy and efficient.
- **Secure Communication**: Ensures all certificate verification processes are secure, using encryption and hashing algorithms.

## Technologies Used

The **Certificate Verifier** project is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating modern, responsive web layouts.
  
- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for server-side scripting.
  - **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used for handling HTTP requests.
  - **Database**: Relational or NoSQL database (e.g., **MongoDB**, **MySQL**) to store certificate data and verification results.

- **Security**:
  - **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
  - **Hashing Algorithms** for ensuring data integrity.
  
- **Other Tools**:
  - **Axios**: To handle HTTP requests for communication with external services.
  - **Docker**: For containerization, ensuring consistent environment setups across all systems.
  - **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

## Installation

Follow these steps to get **Certificate Verifier** running locally:

### Step 1: Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/immortaleyes/CertificateVerifier.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd CertificateVerifier
```

Install the dependencies for both the backend and frontend:

- For the **backend** (Node.js):
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- For the **frontend** (React.js):
  - Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Step 3: Set Up the Database

Set up your **MongoDB** or **MySQL** database and configure the connection string in the `.env` file. 

- For **MongoDB**, you can either install it locally or use **MongoDB Atlas** (cloud service).

### Step 4: Start the Development Server

To start the backend server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the backend server at `http://localhost:5000`.

To start the frontend (React.js), run:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### How to Verify a Certificate:

1. **Enter Certificate Details**: On the homepage, enter the certificate details such as certificate ID, student ID, and the issuing platform (e.g., **HackerRank**, **Coursera**).
2. **Click 'Verify'**: Press the **Verify** button to submit the certificate for validation.
3. **Get Verification Results**: The tool will cross-reference the certificate details with official records to confirm whether the certificate is valid, expired, or tampered with.
4. **Batch Verification**: You can upload a CSV file with multiple certificate details for batch verification.

### Example:

1. Certificate ID: **12345678**
2. Platform: **Coursera**
3. Student ID: **987654321**
